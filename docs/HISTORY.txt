=========

1.5 (unreleased)
---
- Adds a behavior with which any item can be used as a directory item.

  This is a major change to the way directories and their items relate to each
  other internally. All directories using seantis.dir.base have to be migrated
  by adding the new IDirectoryCategorized behavior to the each item and
  reimporting the typeinof.

- Adds category values to KML document
- View now use their own directory specific browserlayer
- Adds ability to define new xls exports through adapters
- Fixes crash in big excel exports

1.4.1
-----
- Provide better default template for result list entry
- Provide a macro for default directory information
- Fixes search viewlet being hidden on item view
- New flag allow_custom_categories on directory which can be used to prevent users
from entering their own categories on items

1.4
---
- Map markers macro is now compatible with both brains and actual objects
- Requires Plone 4.3 to run

1.3
---
- Map markers are now always set in the order of the itemview's batch list.
- The directory no longer uses a homegrown getObject cache and will instead
  use catalog brains as much as possible. Directories building on
  seantis.dir.base might have taken that for granted, so they might be
  incompatible with this version.

  As a result, viewlets registered with the DirectoryItemViewletManager now
  need to expect catalog brains instead of objects.

  The upsides are big performance gains and more stability.
