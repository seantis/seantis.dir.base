  look shiny.

-----
- Exclude \*.mo files from the release

1.5.7
-----
- Show 'Any' instead of 'Whatever'
- Wrap search text in quotes to avoid query parsers errors

1.5.6
-----
- Fixes group-less forms controlled by seantis.dir.base crashing
- Temporarily reintroduces jq as jQuery alias for collective.geo.mapwidget

  and the searchbox is active

1.5.4
-----

- Show 'Whatever' instead of an empty string as default in filter combo boxes

1.5.3
-----
- Render ative/pulsating map markers in front of inactive ones
- Make core form work with directory again
- Prevents code from storing categories as sets (which trips up the keyword index)

1.5.2
-----
- Stop hooking up group forms completely, fixing an issue in seantis.dir.events

1.5.1
-----
- Limit portlet blocking to directory, making it easy to enable portlets for
  all items through the portlet settings of the directory. Fixes #4.
- Fixes form view failing on IDirectoryCategorized items outside a directory
- Fixes form reordering issue on group forms

1.5
---
- Adds a behavior with which any item can be used as a directory item.

  This is a major change to the way directories and their items relate to each
  other internally. All directories using seantis.dir.base have to be migrated
  by adding the new IDirectoryCategorized behavior to the each item and
  reimporting the typeinof.

- Adds category values to KML document
- View now use their own directory specific browserlayer
- Adds ability to define new xls exports through adapters
- Fixes crash in big excel exports
- Removes Directory Item Viewlets in Directory View. They have not been working
  correctly sinde 1.3 anyway.
- Defines slots in macros which may be replaced by directories building on
  seantis.dir.base. This may be used as an alternative to the viewlets.

1.4.1
-----
- Provide better default template for result list entry
- Provide a macro for default directory information
- Fixes search viewlet being hidden on item view
- New flag allow_custom_categories on directory which can be used to prevent users
  from entering their own categories on items

1.4
---
- Map markers macro is now compatible with both brains and actual objects
- Requires Plone 4.3 to run

1.3
---
- Map markers are now always set in the order of the itemview's batch list.
- The directory no longer uses a homegrown getObject cache and will instead
  use catalog brains as much as possible. Directories building on
  seantis.dir.base might have taken that for granted, so they might be
  incompatible with this version.

  As a result, viewlets registered with the DirectoryItemViewletManager now
  need to expect catalog brains instead of objects.

  The upsides are big performance gains and more stability.
